description: Next phase

---

Hi fellow readers,

Since my last entry, this project is considered functional and has been deployed for use in various kinds of production for testing and polish.

Moving forwards, I'm currently in the process of re-negotiating with Mindbender to determine the next phase. If all goes well, I'll be back with updates by end of next week. The most likely thing to happen development wise is emptying outstanding issues.

Till then, enjoy some of the interesting material I've dug up on versioning in a neighboring industry; the web. If you squint, you can *almost* picture them talking about the VFX pipeline where problems ring true to us as well, which means that in most cases the solutions does too.
